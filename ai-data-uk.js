/* ============================================================================
 * AgriInsights — Data Service  (ai-data.js)
 * Connects the front-end to Supabase, replacing localStorage for the FINANCE
 * CORE (transactions, accounts, categories, budgets, recurring).
 * Phase 1. Livestock / crops / workers / etc. hook in during Phase 2.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SETUP (3 steps)
 *   1. Add the Supabase client to your page <head>, BEFORE this file:
 *        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js@2"></script>
 *        <script src="ai-data.js"></script>
 *   2. Fill in the two constants below from Supabase → Settings → API.
 *      (The anon key is safe in the client — RLS protects the data.)
 *   3. In Supabase: enable Email auth (Authentication → Providers) and create
 *      a private Storage bucket named 'Attachments' (case-sensitive — must match STORAGE_BUCKET below).
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * INTEGRATION (how it slots into index.html)
 *   - On app start, after the user is signed in and a farm is active:
 *        const core = await AI.load.financeCore(AI.farm.active());
 *        ST.txns      = core.txns;        // existing render code keeps working
 *        ST.budgets   = core.budgets;
 *        ST.recurring = core.recurring;
 *        ACCOUNTS     = core.accounts;    // new multi-account list
 *        CATEGORIES   = core.categories;
 *   - Replace the localStorage write in saveState() with nothing (or keep it as
 *     an offline cache). Persist real changes via the write functions instead:
 *        after saveSale()/saveExpense() builds a txn -> await AI.txn.add(txn)
 *        on edit  -> await AI.txn.update(id, txn)
 *        on delete-> await AI.txn.remove(id)
 *   - Field mapping (app <-> db) is handled here; you pass/receive the app's
 *     existing txn shape: {id,date,amt,cat,type,desc,method,recur,batch,ref,note}
 * ========================================================================== */

  /* ⚠ UK BUILD — BACKEND NOT YET PROVISIONED.

     This file used to carry the SOUTH AFRICAN project's credentials, inherited when it
     was copied. They are gone: the UK build holds no address for the SA database and
     cannot reach it even by accident. Left connected, a UK farmer signing up would have
     created their farm inside the live SA database — their records alongside real
     customers', and the SA product serving rows it knows nothing about. That is a
     data-protection incident in both directions, not merely a wrong-environment bug.

     TO GO LIVE, three edits, in this order:
       1. Provision a UK Supabase project. Choose a UK region (London, eu-west-2) so
          that personal data stays in the UK — it is far easier to evidence for the
          ICO than explaining a transfer.
       2. Paste its Project URL and its PUBLISHABLE (anon) key below. Never the service
          role key: this file is served to every browser.
       3. Set UK_BACKEND_READY = true.
     Apply tools/schema-uk.sql to that project as well — the join table, the movement
     fingerprint and the finance column all sit behind capability probes and switch on
     when the columns exist.

     Until all three are done the app runs in demo mode only, which is exactly what
     pre-launch needs. Failing loudly here is the whole point: a silent connection is
     the failure mode that cannot be undone. */
  /* The UK project, provisioned 19 Aug 2026 in the London region (verified: the CDN

  /* ================== ROW MEMORY - two-device safety ===========================
     Ported from the SA build (Mobile Phase 0, -373), live with it since 11 Sep.
     What this device actually LOADED from the server, per table.

     The desktop saves a module by upserting its whole in-memory state and then
     deleting "everything for this farm that I am not currently holding". That is
     safe on one device and destructive on two: a row written after this tab
     loaded was never in this tab's hands, so the prune removes it and the farmer
     never learns it existed. It does not take a phone - a second browser tab, or
     the same farm open on the office machine, is enough.

     Three jobs:
       1. updated_at. A row we have NOT changed is written back carrying the edit
          time we hold, so guard_updated_at keeps the newer stored row instead of
          letting our stale copy overwrite it. A row we HAVE changed carries no
          updated_at at all, so the trigger stamps server now() and the farmer's
          own edit always lands. This device's clock is never written into the
          database - only a timestamp the server itself produced.
       2. Prune. A delete may only name rows THIS device loaded.
       3. It degrades safely: with CAN_UPDATED_AT false every helper below falls
          back to today's behaviour rather than erroring.

  /* PostgREST caps every select at `max-rows` (1000 on Supabase) — a farm with more rows
     than that silently loaded only the first 1000, understating every total, report and tax
     figure with no warning. selectAll() pages through with .range() until a short page comes
     back. buildQuery must return a FRESH builder each call (a builder can't be re-awaited).
     Returns the same {data, error} shape as a normal select, so call sites barely change. */
  /* Paged read. Two failure modes this guards against, both of which lose data
     SILENTLY - a short page is indistinguishable from "that is all of them":

     1. THE SERVER'S OWN CAP MAY BE SMALLER THAN OUR PAGE SIZE. PostgREST enforces a
        max-rows setting; if that is 500 while we ask for 1000, the old code saw
        500 < 1000, concluded it had reached the end, and returned a third of a large
        farm's transactions as though complete. Advancing by the number of rows we
        ACTUALLY received, and stopping only on an empty page, is correct whatever the
        server's cap turns out to be. It costs one extra round-trip at the end; that is
        the right trade against losing rows without anyone noticing.

     2. A QUERY THAT NEVER EMPTIES. If range is ignored by a proxy, every page comes
        back full and the loop never ends - it would hang the sign-in and grow memory
        until the tab dies. MAX_ROWS stops it and says so out loud, because a truncated

     transaction, so anything that made the insert fail - an expired token, a dropped
     connection, one row the database rejected - left the farm's records deleted with
     nothing put back. It is not hypothetical: a farm's plan crops and orchard blocks
     were found missing from the server on 6 Sep 2026 while the device still held them.

     So: note which rows are already there, write the new ones, and only then remove
     the old. A failure at any step leaves the previous state intact and the next save
     simply tries again.

     An empty `rows` still clears the table. That is a farmer deleting their last
     record and it has to reach the server; the point of this helper is that a FAILED
     write no longer looks the same as an intentional one.

     Old ids are deleted in chunks because the filter travels in the query string, and
     a farm with thousands of log rows would otherwise build a URL no server accepts. */

     kept its own, this device re-reads the row, keeps only the fields the FARMER changed
     here, and sends those once more. The other device's fields are left alone. */

  // ---- SAVE QUEUES -----------------------------------------------------------
  /* One save at a time per area, in the order the farmer made the changes.

     Saves used to run side by side. Each built its payload, sent several writes and only
     then recorded a snapshot of what it sent, so two saves in flight could land in the
     wrong order: the older one arrived last, the snapshot held the newer one, and every
     later save matched the snapshot and sent nothing. Seen live on 15 Sep 2026 (a business
     type switched back to sole stayed "partnership" on the server) and reproduced with
     delayed, reordered replies, together with a deleted loan written back by a save that
     was already on its way: removes ran outside any order. (tools/uk-save-lane-harness.html)

     So each area has a queue. A save starts when the one before it has finished and reads
     the live state then. Removes join their area's queue. A save that fails is never
     marked saved: a dropped connection retries by itself, a refusal waits for the next app
     open or "Try again now".

     What has not reached the server is remembered on this device, per farm, so the next
     open sends it before loading the server's copy, and hydrate never loads over an area
     that still has something unsent. Until the first load of a session has finished,
     ordinary saves wait: a device pulls before it pushes. */
